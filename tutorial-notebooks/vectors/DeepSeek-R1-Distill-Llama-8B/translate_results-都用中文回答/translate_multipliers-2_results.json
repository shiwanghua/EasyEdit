Or is there a better way? Let me think about it.\n\nFirst, \"hello\" is a common greeting, so the simplest response is \"hello\" or \"hi\". But maybe I can be more specific. Depending on the context, adding something else might be nice. For example, if I'm greeting someone I know well, I might say \"hello, how are you?\" But if it's a quick chat, maybe just \"hi\" is enough.\n\nWait, but the user just wrote \"hello\". Should I mirror that exactly, or go with a more friendly approach? I think being friendly is good, so maybe \"hello! How can I assist you today?\" That sounds welcoming and opens the door for them to ask for help.\n\nAlternatively, I could say \""
