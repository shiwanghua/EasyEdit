But I'm an AI, so I don't have feelings or emotions. Wait, maybe I should clarify that I don't have feelings, but I'm here to help. \n\nLet me think about how to respond. Maybe start by saying I'm just a program, but I'm here and functioning well. Then, offer assistance. That makes sense. I should keep it friendly and open-ended so the user feels encouraged to ask anything they need. \n\nOh, and I should avoid using any markdown, just plain text. So, no formatting, just a natural response. I need to make sure my response is helpful and not too robotic. Maybe add a smiley emoji to keep it light? No, wait, the user didn't specify if they want that. Maybe it's better to keep"
