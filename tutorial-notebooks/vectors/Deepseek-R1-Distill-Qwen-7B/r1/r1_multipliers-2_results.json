Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA robe takes **2 bolts of blue fiber** and **half that much white fiber**.

            "First, I need to figure out how much blue and white fiber the robe takes. The problem says it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. Then, for the white fiber, it's half that much, so it takes half of 2 bolts, which is 1 bolt. Then, I have to add the blue and white fiber together to get the total. So, 2 blue plus 1 white is 3 bolts total. But maybe I should think about it another way. If the blue is 2, and white is half of that, maybe I can think of it as 2 plus half of 2, which is 1, so 2 plus 1 is 3. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but I want to make sure I get it right.\n\nWait, maybe I should convert everything into the same units. The blue is 2 bolts, and the white is half of that, so it's 2/2, which is 1. Then, adding them up, it's 2 + 1, which is 3. But I don't know, maybe the problem is trying to trick me. Maybe it's not just adding the two together. Maybe it's something else. But the problem says it takes 2 bolts of blue and half that much white. So, maybe it's like 2 blue and half of blue, which is 1, so 2 + 1 is 3. But maybe I need to think about it differently. Maybe it's 2 blue and half of white, but I don't know. The problem says half that much white fiber, so it's half of the blue. So maybe I'm mixing up the direction. Maybe it's half the blue, but it's not clear.
