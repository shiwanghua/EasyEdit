            "First, identify the amount of blue fiber required for the robe, which is 2 bolts.\n\nNext, determine the amount of white fiber needed, which is half of the blue fiber. Calculating half of 2 bolts gives 1 bolt.\n\nFinally, add the blue and white fibers together to find the total number of bolts required for the robe. 2 bolts plus 1 bolt equals 3 bolts in total.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of bolts required for the robe, let's break down the materials needed:\n\n1. **Blue Fiber:**\n   - The robe requires **2 bolts** of blue fiber.\n\n2. **White Fiber:**\n   - The robe requires **half** that amount of white fiber.\n   - Half of 2 bolts is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 \\text{ bolts}}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Total Bolts:**\n   - Add the blue and white fibers together:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \\text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \\text{ bolts}\n     \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]"
