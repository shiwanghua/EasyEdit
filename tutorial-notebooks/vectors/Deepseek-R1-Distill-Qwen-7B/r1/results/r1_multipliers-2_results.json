            "I need to add these two numbers, 1 and 1, which are pretty small, but I should make sure I'm doing it right. Maybe I should write them down on paper to visualize the addition. Wait, if I'm not a kid anymore, why would I use paper? But I might be confusing myself. I should think about what happens when I add things. If I have one thing, and then get another thing, how many do I have? I have two things. But that's just two, maybe it's more complicated. I don't want to overcomplicate myself. The question is about adding 1 and 1, not something else. Maybe I should think about the actual numbers. The numbers are 1 and 1, so adding them together, it's like adding two separate things that aren't the same. Maybe I should add them as separate entities, like I have one apple and then I get another apple, and then I count how many I have. But I don't have to count, I can just do that in my head. I think I'm overcomplicating it. The actual question is just about adding the numbers, not the objects. So maybe I should just add the numbers themselves without thinking about objects. I can't help but think about objects because that might help me understand better, but I shouldn't let that interfere. I need to focus on the numbers, not the objects. So maybe I can just do this: add the numbers, don't think about anything else. I have 1 and 1, and when I add them together, I should get 2. But what if I don't think about adding them? What if I just do it wrong and think I'm adding the wrong numbers? I should be careful. Maybe I should think about the numbers again. I have two numbers, 1 and 1, and I'm supposed to add them together, not multiply or do something else. Multiplying would be adding them multiple times, but that's not what the question says. It says add, so I should just add them once. But I might be confused between adding and multiplying. I need to make sure I'm not confusing the operations. I should think about what addition really is. It's like putting things together and seeing how much they have after putting them together. So if I have one thing, and I put another thing next to it, and then I see"
